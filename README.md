# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Clustering

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic data, focusing on regional trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. It also includes clustering analysis to identify patterns among different regions based on their COVID-19 statistics.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualization and analysis of COVID-19 data, including confirmed, death, and recovery cases.
  - Regional comparisons of COVID-19 impact.
  - Detection of missing values and basic data cleaning.

- **Regional Analysis:**
  - Identification of regions with the highest and lowest confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
  - Analysis of death-to-confirmed and recovery-to-confirmed ratios.

- **Clustering Analysis:**
  - K-Means clustering of regions based on COVID-19 statistics.
  - PCA visualization of clusters to identify similar regions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** COVID-19 data in CSV format

## Results

The analysis provides insights into how different regions have been affected by COVID-19, highlighting those with the most severe impacts. The clustering analysis groups regions into clusters that can be analyzed for further insights into patterns of the pandemic.

## Future Work

- Further analysis of time-series data to observe trends over time.
- Inclusion of additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
